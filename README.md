This project is about a page replacement simulator that schedules the processes
according to the Round Robin algorithm and after that, these processes go throw
two-page replacement algorithms ( FIFO and LRU) algorithms to calculate the page
fault for each process, the total page fault, and the total cycles without using threads.
